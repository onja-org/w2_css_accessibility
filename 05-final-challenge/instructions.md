# Challenge 5: Final Challenge - Putting It All Together

## The Big Picture
Congratulations! You've learned about three key aspects of CSS accessibility:
1. **Color Contrast** - Making text readable for everyone
2. **Focus Indicators** - Helping keyboard users navigate
3. **Responsive Text** - Ensuring content works when zoomed

Now it's time to put it all together!

## Your Mission
You'll be working on a real-world website that has **multiple accessibility issues**. Your job is to find and fix them all using everything you've learned.

## The Challenge
1. **Open `challenge.html` in your browser**
   - This is a restaurant website with several accessibility problems
   - Try navigating with Tab key, zooming to 200%, and squinting at the text

2. **Identify the problems:**
   - Poor color contrast in multiple places
   - Missing or unclear focus indicators
   - Text that breaks or gets cut off when zoomed
   - Error messages that only use color

3. **Fix everything in `starter.css`:**
   - Make all text pass WCAG AA contrast standards (4.5:1 ratio)
   - Add clear focus indicators to all interactive elements
   - Ensure the layout works perfectly at 200% zoom
   - Use techniques beyond just color for important information

## Success Criteria
Your solution should pass **ALL** of these tests:

### Color Contrast ‚úì
- [ ] All text is easily readable
- [ ] Error messages don't rely only on color
- [ ] Links are distinguishable from regular text
- [ ] DevTools shows no contrast warnings

### Focus Indicators ‚úì
- [ ] Tab through entire page - always know where you are
- [ ] All buttons, links, and form fields have visible focus
- [ ] Focus indicators work on both light and dark sections
- [ ] Focus indicators are thick/clear enough to see

### Responsive Text ‚úì
- [ ] Zoom to 200% - all content still accessible
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling needed
- [ ] All text remains readable and properly sized
- [ ] Layout adapts gracefully to larger text

### Bonus Points ‚úì
- [ ] Maintains the restaurant's visual branding
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Works well for users with different needs

## üí° Pro Tips
- Test each fix in isolation first
- Use DevTools to check contrast ratios
- Actually try keyboard navigation yourself
- Zoom to 200% frequently while working
- Remember: good accessibility often improves the experience for everyone!

## Real-World Impact
The techniques you're practicing here make websites usable for:
- People with visual impairments who need high contrast
- Users who navigate with keyboards instead of mice
- Anyone who needs to zoom their browser for better readability
- People using screen readers (focus indicators help here too!)

## Test Your Final Solution
1. **Contrast Test:** Check all text in DevTools
2. **Keyboard Test:** Tab through the entire page
3. **Zoom Test:** Zoom to 200% and try to use everything
4. **Real User Test:** Ask someone else to try your site!

## When You're Done
Compare your solution with `solution.css` to see one possible approach. Remember, there are often multiple ways to solve accessibility problems!

**Great job completing this accessibility lab!** You now have the fundamental skills to make websites more inclusive and usable for everyone. Keep practicing these techniques in your future projects - your users will thank you! üéâ
