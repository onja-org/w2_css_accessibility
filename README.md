# CSS Accessibility Lab

Welcome! In this self-guided lab, you'll learn how CSS choices can make websites more accessible to all users.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you'll be able to:
- Identify and fix color contrast issues
- Create keyboard-friendly focus indicators
- Build layouts that work at 200% zoom
- Respect user motion preferences

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onja-org/w1_css_accessibility
    ```
2. Open `01-start-here/index.html` in your browser
3. Work through each numbered folder in order
4. Each folder has its own `instructions.md` - start there!

## ⏱️ Time Estimate
- **Total time**: ~60 minutes

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Need
- A text editor
- A web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- DevTools (we'll show you how to use them!)

## 📁 How This Lab Works
Each folder contains:
- `instructions.md` - Your guide for that section
- `challenge.html` - The page you'll be fixing
- `starter.css` - CSS file you'll edit
- `solution.css` - Check this if you get stuck (try not to peek!)

Ready? Head to `01-start-here/` to begin!
