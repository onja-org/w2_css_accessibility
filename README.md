# CSS Accessibility Lab

Welcome to your comprehensive journey into CSS accessibility! This hands-on lab will transform how you think about inclusive web design, teaching you to create websites that work beautifully for everyone.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you'll master:
- **Color Contrast**: Identify and fix contrast issues that affect readability
- **Focus Indicators**: Create clear, keyboard-friendly navigation paths  
- **Responsive Text**: Build layouts that remain usable at 200% zoom
- **Motion Preferences**: Respect user settings for reduced motion
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use browser tools to audit and improve accessibility

## 🌟 Why This Matters
Web accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about creating inclusive experiences. The techniques you'll learn benefit:
- Users with visual impairments or color blindness
- People navigating with keyboards or assistive devices
- Anyone using your site in challenging conditions (bright sunlight, small screens, etc.)
- Search engines and automated tools

1. **Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
2. **Setup**: Open this workspace in your preferred code editor
3. **Navigation**: Start with `lab/instructions.md` and work through the numbered folders sequentially
4. **Testing**: Use a modern browser with developer tools enabled

## ⏱️ Time Investment
- **Total Duration**: 60-90 minutes
- **Introduction**: 10 minutes - Understanding web accessibility basics
- **Color Contrast**: 20 minutes - Fixing contrast issues
- **Focus Indicators**: 15 minutes - Keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Text**: 20 minutes - Zoom accessibility  
- **Final Challenge**: 15-25 minutes - Putting it all together

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources
- **Code Editor**: VS Code, Sublime, or your preferred editor
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox (with DevTools)
