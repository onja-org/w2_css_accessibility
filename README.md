# CSS Accessibility Lab

Welcome! In this self-guided lab, you'll learn how CSS choices can make websites more accessible to all users.

- Respect user motion preferences

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Watch this introduction video about WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines): [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H1JGdqLrWo)
    - This will help you get an idea of some of the standards that exist for web accessibility
1. Watch this video to get an understanding of the importance of accessibility in web design: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEbl5jvLKGQ)
    - It is our duty to be inclusive and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities
2. Clone this repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/onja-org/w2_css_accessibility
    ```
3. Open `01-start-here/index.html` in your browser
4. Work through each numbered folder in order
5. Each folder has its own `instructions.md` - start there!

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate
- **Total time**: 60 minutes
- Each section shows estimated time, but work at your own pace
- If you're short on time, prioritize sections 1-3

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You'll Need
- A text editor
- A web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- DevTools (we'll show you how to use them!)

## üìÅ How This Lab Works
Each folder contains:
- `instructions.md` - Your guide for that section
- `challenge.html` - The page you'll be fixing
- `starter.css` - CSS file you'll edit
- `solution.css` - Check this if you get stuck (try not to peek!)

Ready? Head to `01-start-here/` to begin!
